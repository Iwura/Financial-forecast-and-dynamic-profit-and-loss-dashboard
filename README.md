Predicted Strong, base, and weak case scenarios for revenue growth of up to 5%, operating margin of up to 0.17, and gross margin of up to 0.56 implemented to forecast revenue, gross profit, and EBIT for 2017 and 2018.

Performance comparison of the industrial and the energy sector in terms of gross profit from 2012 to 2016 shows the Industrial sector pulled a better average performance of about $6.24 billion across individual companies than the energy sector at $4.96 billion.

The least gross profit generated across companies was higher in the industrial sector ($695,600) than the energy sector ($72,143) however the most profit generated was higher in the energy sector ($81.78 billion) while at $45.42 billion within the industrial sector.

A range of $44.72 billion for the industrial sector and $81.77 billion for the energy sector indicates that gross profit is more spread in the energy sector than in the industrial sector.
